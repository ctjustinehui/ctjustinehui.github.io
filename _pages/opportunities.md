#### One Funded PhD projects at the University of Auckland


**Elderly users’ speech perception and listening effort in virtual acoustics funded by Meta**

Virtual spaces can allow users to create more meaningful online time and bridge physical distances. Recent years have seen a rise in AR/VR products targeted at elderly users for rehabilitation and communication, where they can benefit from such technologies especially with the current pandemic, being isolated due to health and travel risks. However, introducing new technologies to elderly users may be met with resistance, especially if the elderly users have trouble trusting the applications. This is particularly true when using a VR/AR product for communication purposes, where it is important to understand speech in these virtual acoustic environments without added listening effort. At the same time, normal hearing elderly listeners have shown to struggle with listening to speech in adverse and unfamiliar environments. This project will explore how they respond to speech in virtual audio environments. 

We are looking for 1 PhD candidate to join our team (Dr Justine Hui, AP Yusuke Hioka, A/P Catherine Watson, Dr Hinako Masuda) to investigate the above project. The project is funded by Meta, and the student will be hosted at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Auckland. 

We are seeking applicants with a masters or honours degree in Science (Speech and Hearing Sciences, Psychology, Linguistics), Engineering (including Electrical/Computer Systems/Software/Biomedical/Mechanical Engineering/Engineering Science or Computer Science) or a related discipline. 

A suitable candidate should ideally have:

+ Competent coding skills and be comfortable with learning new technologies
+ Knowledge in signal processing
+ Experience with conducting human involved experiments and/or confidence in communicating with elderly participants
+ Interest in virtual acoustics, speech sciences, hearing sciences, psychology and signal processing

Funding amount: NZD 33,000 stipend plus tuition fees per annum for three years.

Please send your CV and transcript to justine.hui at auckland.ac.nz

#### Two Funded Master’s projects at the University of Auckland funded by the Royal Society of New Zealand

**Understanding te reo Māori sounds in our acoustically varied world funded by RSNZ**  

We are looking for two domestic Master’s students to join our team (Dr Justine Hui, Dr Peter Keegan, A/P Catherine Watson) to examine how we hear speech sounds, (in particular, te reo Māori) in different acoustic environments. The project is funded by a Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden fast-start grant, and the students will be hosted at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Auckland. One Master’s student will be designing and implementing a virtual acoustics system to examine how we perceive sounds in our acoustically varied world, and the other will focus on investigating how listeners of different te reo Māori knowledge perceive the sounds in various acoustic environments. 

We are seeking applicants with a degree in Science (Speech and Hearing Sciences, Psychology, Linguistics), Engineering (including Electrical/Computer Systems/Software/Biomedical/Mechanical Engineering/Engineering Science or Computer Science) or a related discipline. 

A suitable candidate should ideally have:

+ Knowledge and/or strong interest in te reo Māori, phonetics and acoustics
+ Interest in speech sciences, acoustics, psychology and signal processing
+ Some coding skills and be comfortable with learning new technologies

Funding amount: NZD 22,000 stipend plus tuition fees for one year.

Please send your CV and transcript to justine.hui at auckland.ac.nz

#### Other opportunities:

Potential PhD projects in areas of: speech and hearing sciences, phonetics, speech perception and production, hearing impairment and hearing assistive devices, second language acquisition 

A suitable candidate should ideally have a masters or honours degree in  Engineering (including Electrical/Computer Systems/Software/Biomedical/Mechanical Engineering/Engineering Science or Computer Science), Science (Speech and Hearing Sciences, Psychology, Linguistics), or a related discipline. 

See the [University of Auckland Doctoral Scholarship page](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/study/scholarships-and-awards/scholarship-types/postgraduate-scholarships/doctoral-scholarships.html) for funding. 

Please send your proposal related to any of the above topics and CV and transcript to justine.hui at auckland.ac.nz
