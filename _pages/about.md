### Hello!

I completed my conjoint BE(1st class Hons) in Computer Systems Engineering and BA(Hons) (BA in Linguistics and Japanese and BA(Hons) in Asian Studies) at the University of Auckland. This was followed by several years in industry at IBM (project at Unitec/Air NZ), while I obtained a ME with A/P Catherine Watson on **speech synthesis for healthcare robots**. I received my PhD at Sophia University, Japan, at the [Speech Communication Lab](https://splab.net/) under Prof. Takayuki Arai on the relationship between **hearing deficits and speech and melody perception**.

#### Research

For my postdoctoral fellowship, I was involved in examining how **language familiarity affects our understanding of speech in different acoustic environments** at the [Communication Acoustics Lab](https://cal.auckland.ac.nz/) while being involved in the [MPAi (Māori pronunciation aid)](https://maonze.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/mpai-the-maori-pronunciation-tool/) project on developing a computer interface based application for users to learn and improve their **Māori vowel pronunciation based on their speech acoustics**. Now I lecture at the Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering at Uni of Auckland. 

My current research interests include **speech perception and production of hearing impaired listeners and 2nd language listeners**, **hearing sciences and assistive technologies**, [using virtual acoustics to examine our perception in daily acoustic conditions](projects/speechIntelligibility/), and phonetics focusing on [Japanese](projects/JapanesePA/) and [te reo Māori](projects/teReoMaori/). I also enjoy scrolling through statistical/R related tweets/posts and like experimenting with data visualisation (mainly speech related data). 

Some days I will post some of the tools that I use to make my analyses/tasks more easily.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. --->
