Justine obtained her conjoint BE(1st class Hons) in Computer Systems Engineering and BA(Hons) (BA in Linguistics and Japanese and BA(Hons) in Asian Studies) at the University of Auckland. This was followed by several years in industry at IBM (project at Unitec/Air NZ), while she studied a ME with Dr. Catherine Watson on speech synthesis for healthcare robots. She received her PhD at Sophia University, Japan, at the [Speech Communication Lab](https://splab.net/) under Prof. Takayuki Arai on the relationship between hearing deficits and speech and melody perception.

### Research

After her PhD, she came back to Auckland as a postdoctoral research fellow (PI: A/P Yusuke Hioka) examining how language familiarity affects our understanding of speech in different acoustic environments while being involved in the [MPAi (Māori pronunciation aid)](https://maonze.blogs.auckland.ac.nz/mpai-the-maori-pronunciation-tool/) project with A/P Catherine Watson, Dr. Peter Keegan and Dr. Danielle Lottridge, on developing a computer interface based application for users to learn and improve their Māori vowel pronunciation by getting real-time visual feedback.

Her main research interests include speech perception and production of hearing impaired listeners and non-native speakers, hearing sciences and assistive technologies, virtual acoustics, and phonetics focusing on Japanese and te reo Māori.

She is currently a lecturer at the Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Auckland.
